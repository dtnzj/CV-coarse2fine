I added
	new file:   IMG30.JPG
	new file:   cam.py
        new file:   fly.jpg
        new file:   mario.jpg
        new file:   pyramids.py
        new file:   pyramids_2.py
        new file:   res.png
        new file:   temp.py
        new file:   temp2.py
        new file:   template.jpg
for that I'm afraid that my computer get some risk, and I need to reinstall the OS.

These files are my first test to achieve the courese-to-fine template matching with python openCV.

Up to now, I could match the template and make pyramids for images.
But there are several points that they are too closed to each other.
I need to define a compare function to select the best ones.
